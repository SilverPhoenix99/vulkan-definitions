# Vulkan Definitions

This gem contains definitions for Vulkan functions and extensions.

It's not meant to be executable code. Instead its focus is to provide constants and function definitions to Ruby.
They can then be used with FFI, for example.

## Installation

    $ gem install vulkan-definitions
